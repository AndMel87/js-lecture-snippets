//Numbers

var a = 2 + 3; //5

var b = 10 - 2; //8

var c = 3 * 3; //9

var d = 6 / 2; //3

//the modulo operation finds the remainder after division of one number by another

9 % 6 //9 divided by 6 gives a remainder of 3
16 % 4 //The remainder is 0

1++ //1+1
1-- //1-1
x+=y // is the same as x = x + y
